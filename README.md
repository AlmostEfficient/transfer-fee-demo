# transfer-fee-demo
Create a token that has a transfer fee on every transfer using Javascript! Uses the transfer fee extension on the Token-22 program.

## Setup - Node.js, pnpm, git
Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Clone or download this repository and navigate to the directory in your terminal. I recommend using pnpm to install dependencies, get it [here](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation). Then run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.

## I don't know what any of this means
You're gonna be fine! We'll be doing this on the devnet, which is a test network that doesn't use real money. You don't need to understand how *everything* works, just try to figure out what you're doing at a high level. (i.e. wtf is a package manager?)

If you don't know a term or a specific step, just google it. I highly recommend [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for learning about new concepts.
